# fsharpanimalquizgtk

this is the same as "fsharpanimalquiz" repo (https://github.com/tonyx/fsharpanimalquiz)
except that here you can run it in a simple gtk box by addin the parameter "gui" on the command line.

(note: at the moment I keep those project separately, just to make sure there is still one that doesn't require gtk lib in build)

This code is related to a serie of blog posts
